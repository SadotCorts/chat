# chat
Simple chat application with nodejs

This is the first practice to distribuited systems, this chat was made with
[Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/), [ExpressJs](http://expressjs.com/) &
[Socketio](https://socket.io/), to start the project first clone the repo, make
sure have Git installed, and then use: `git clone https://github.com/SadotCorts/chat.git` in your console emulator, next make sure have Node & npm installed. Go to the chat/ folder and use `npm install` to download all the dependencies used in the project, when the download is finished use `npm start` to start the app. next go to `http://localhost:3000/` in your browser and enjoy the chat app.
